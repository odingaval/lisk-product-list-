## My process

### Built with

- **HTML5**: Semantic markup with proper accessibility attributes
- **CSS3**: 
  - Custom properties (CSS variables) for consistent theming
  - Flexbox and CSS Grid for responsive layouts
  - Mobile-first responsive design approach
  - Smooth animations and transitions
- **JavaScript (ES6+)**: 
  - Class-based architecture for maintainable code
  - Local Storage API for cart persistence
  - Event delegation and proper error handling
- **Responsive Design**: 
  - Responsive images (mobile, tablet, desktop)
  - Breakpoint-based layout adjustments
  - Touch-friendly interface elements

### What I learned

This project helped me reinforce several important concepts:

**üé® CSS Architecture:**
- Using CSS custom properties for consistent theming and easy maintenance
- Mobile-first responsive design with progressive enhancement
- CSS Grid for flexible layouts that adapt to different screen sizes
- Proper use of Flexbox for component-level layouts
- Smooth animations and hover effects for better UX

**‚ö° JavaScript Best Practices:**
- Class-based architecture for better code organization and reusability
- Event delegation and proper event handling to avoid memory leaks
- Local Storage for state persistence across browser sessions
- Async/await for clean data fetching and error handling
- Debouncing for performance optimization on window resize events

**‚ôø Accessibility:**
- Semantic HTML structure for better screen reader support
- Proper focus management and keyboard navigation
- ARIA attributes and alt text for images
- Color contrast compliance with WCAG guidelines
- Touch-friendly interface elements for mobile users

**Key Code Snippets:**

```javascript
// Cart state management with Local Storage
class Cart {
  saveToStorage() {
    localStorage.setItem('cart', JSON.stringify(Array.from(this.items.entries())));
  }
  
  loadFromStorage() {
    const saved = localStorage.getItem('cart');
    if (saved) {
      this.items = new Map(JSON.parse(saved));
    }
  }
}
```

```css
/* Responsive design with CSS Grid */
.products-grid {
  display: grid;
  grid-template-columns: repeat(auto-fit, minmax(280px, 1fr));
  gap: var(--spacing-md);
}

@media (min-width: 768px) {
  .content {
    grid-template-columns: 1fr 350px;
  }
}
```

### Continued development

Areas I'd like to continue improving:

1. **üöÄ Performance Optimization**: 
   - Implement virtual scrolling for large product lists
   - Add image lazy loading and optimization
   - Implement code splitting for better load times

2. **üìä State Management**: 
   - Consider using a more robust state management solution for larger applications
   - Add undo/redo functionality for cart operations

3. **üß™ Testing**: 
   - Add unit tests and integration tests
   - Implement end-to-end testing with Cypress or Playwright

4. **üé≠ Animation**: 
   - Add more sophisticated animations and transitions
   - Implement skeleton loading states

5. **üì± PWA Features**: 
   - Add service worker for offline functionality
   - Implement push notifications for order updates
